# Crashed

Better than App Locker. This application is widget. Add widget on home-screen. Choose icon and name as you wish and it will create widget which looks same as app. As soon as people will mistake it as app and tap it, it shows error and thus you can say "Hey it crashes since last update, will have to re-install it" and thus your original app remains safe. Have additional layer of security!
